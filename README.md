- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently open for work on open source projects. The Academy Software Foundation material standard: [MaterialX](https://materialx.org/) is my primary focus along with
it's interrelation with industry standards: [Khronos glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) and [Pixar USD](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/index.html). Also of focus is MaterialX's interlation with standards such as OCIO (colour management),
and shading languages: OSL (Open Shading Language), MDL, and GLSL for both desktop and web rendering.
